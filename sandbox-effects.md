Independent mechanical facts that share one trigger surface: the Claude Code
command sandbox distorting git, filesystem, transcript, and IPC operations.
Each section stands alone.

## Stranded `.git/index.lock` (sandbox breaks it)

A `git add` run inside the Bash sandbox can succeed at staging while failing to
remove `.git/index.lock`. Nothing looks wrong until the *next* command: `git
commit` runs its `pre-commit` hook, the hook's own `git add` tries to take the
lock, and git reports `Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists. Another
git process seems to be running` — naming a concurrent process that does not
exist. Re-running the identical command with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`
succeeds.

Observed 2026-07-21 in gitlore: `git add <file> && git commit` in one sandboxed
Bash call. Staging succeeded (`git status` showed `A `), the commit aborted, and
git cleaned the lock on abort — by the time you look the evidence is destroyed.

Diagnostic that settles it: `GIT_TRACE=1 git commit` unsandboxed. It prints
`run_command: GIT_EDITOR=: GIT_INDEX_FILE=.git/index .../hooks/pre-commit` —
proving git has NOT taken `index.lock` when `pre-commit` runs, so a hook's bare
`git add` is legitimate and a lock present at that moment is a leftover, not
contention.

Do not "fix" the hook in response. A staging hook's `GIT_INDEX_FILE`
capture/restore ([[git-hook-env-leak]]) is a different bug with the
same error string: that one fires under `-a`/pathspec commits where git really
does hold the lock. Distinguish by whether an unsandboxed retry succeeds — a
real hook bug fails either way.

## A masked lock file fakes a crashed repo — and a real stale lock looks identical

Distinct from the stranded lock above: the sandbox can mask `.git/index.lock`
itself, so `git commit`/`git add` fails `fatal: Unable to create
'.git/index.lock': File exists` over a lock that does not exist at all. The
stock advice — "a git process may have crashed; remove the file manually" — is
the wrong move. The tell is that the message is self-contradictory (creation
*failed*, yet a file is *there*), plus a zero-byte lock, no git process in
`ps`, and a sandboxed `ls` that showed nothing a moment earlier. Confirm by
running `ls` on the lock with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` — the path does
not exist — then re-run the commit unsandboxed, which succeeds. This can start
mid-session; earlier commits in the very same session went through sandboxed.

**The discriminator, because a genuinely stale lock has the same surface
signature.** On 2026-07-23 a `SessionStart:clear` error — `could not lock
config file .git/config: File exists`, from gitlore's session hook
(`cc-hooks/session-start.sh` writes `git config gitlore.hooksDir` /
`commitCommand` every session) — showed a `.git/config.lock` that looked
exactly like a mask: `-r--r--r-- … 0`, synthetic-identical birth/mtime/ctime.
It was real. What separated them: it **persisted with
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`** (a mask vanishes; a real lock does not), an
unsandboxed `git config` write failed the same way, and no process held it
(`fuser` empty) — a genuine orphaned lock from a `git config` write killed
mid-rename two days earlier, plausibly OOM.

So the 0-byte/read-only shape alone proves nothing, and the correct action is
opposite in the two cases: leave a mask alone and retry unsandboxed; `rm` a
real stale lock, after which the write recovers and it does not reappear.
Always run the unsandboxed existence test, then `rm`-and-retry, before deciding
which one you have — deleting a lock you have not proven stale is the dangerous
move, and the sandbox makes an entirely healthy repo look like a crashed one.

## Strict sandbox mode blocks the escape (no `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`)

When my human partner has enabled strict sandbox mode (`/sandbox` → "Strict
sandbox mode"), `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` is blocked. Git write
operations (`git add`, `git commit`) then fail with "Read-only file system" on
`.git/index.lock`. Strict mode disables the override mechanism entirely; the
filesystem restriction is enforced at the OS level and cannot be bypassed by the
agent.

**How to apply:** ask my human partner to run the command via `! git …`, or to
toggle sandbox mode first (`/sandbox` → unsandboxed fallback). Do NOT retry the
same sandboxed command or try workarounds.

**Strict mode is a user setting and is often off.** Do not read this section as
"the escape never works" — check rather than assume. In the 2026-07-21 session
recorded under `$TMPDIR` below, strict mode was *not* in force and
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox` worked normally; that is why the `just release` run
there succeeded with it.

## Phantom home dotfiles and sibling-worktree writes (sandbox breaks them)

In the gitlore repo the sandbox distorts some git/filesystem operations
(verified 2026-07-17).

1. **Phantom dotfiles.** A sandboxed working-tree read surfaces user-home
   dotfiles absent from the repo — `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`,
   `.zprofile`, `.profile`, `.gitconfig`, `.ripgreprc`, `.idea`, `.vscode`,
   `.mcp.json`. So a sandboxed `git status` reports spurious untracked files.
   Ground truth: the repo's real dotfiles are only `.claude .claude-plugin
   .editorconfig .envrc .git .gitignore .gitlore .gitmodules`.
2. **Sibling-worktree writes blocked.** The sandbox grants write access only to
   the current worktree (`.`) plus `.git`. From a linked worktree, a git op
   writing a *sibling* path fails with `Read-only file system` — e.g. `git -C
   <main-root> merge/push <branch>` (finishing a worktree branch into main) or
   `git worktree remove <other>`. The merge half-prints "Updating …" then aborts
   cleanly (no `MERGE_HEAD`), so retry unsandboxed.

**Two masking shapes, and the newer one lands inside the repo.** The original
form is a character device (`crw-rw-rw- nobody nogroup`) standing in for a
deny-listed path. Since 2026-07-20 deny-listed paths also appear as **zero-byte
read-only regular files** (`-r--r--r-- … 0`) — `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, and
`.claude/{agents,commands,hooks,skills,workflows,routines,launch.json,
scheduled_tasks.json}` — and a path that ought to be a DIRECTORY gets a
zero-byte file too. Three things make this read as a real problem when it is
not: they show as untracked (`??`) in `git status`; they appear part-way
through a session, so an early `git status` in the same session showed none of
them; and they are visible with the sandbox OFF (both via
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox` and via the `unsandbox-git-status` hook), so "it is
only the sandboxed view" does not explain them away. Do not delete them, do not
commit them, do not raise them as a finding.

**They are real files while a sandbox is in effect, and the sandbox need not be
yours.** They materialize on the filesystem whenever *some* agent is running a
sandboxed Bash command, and are visible to every process for as long as that
lasts — which is why an unsandboxed reader sees them and why they come and go
rather than accumulating. With parallel subagents this is not rare: a
controller's own unsandboxed `git status` shows a clean tree one moment and
fourteen phantom dotfiles the next, purely because a subagent happened to be
mid-`Bash` call. So absence proves nothing about a later moment, and presence
says nothing about the repo — do not conclude from one clean reading that
`git add -A` is safe here, and always stage explicit pathspecs when any other
agent is live.

**They break `git add -A` under the sandbox**: `error: .bash_profile: can only
add regular files, symbolic links or git-directories`, and the whole `add`
aborts. Stage with explicit pathspecs. Re-running the same `git add -A` with
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` is a second way out only when yours is the
only sandbox in play — the auto classifier lets it through, and with no sandbox
in effect the stand-ins are not there to choke on (verified with `git add -An`)
— but per the paragraph above it does nothing while another agent is mid-`Bash`
call, since the files are real for every process for as long as that lasts.

`.envrc` vars pass through the sandbox: `MARKETPLACE_DIR` and the `DIRENV_*`
vars are present in the sandboxed env (direnv runs in the launching shell). The
variable arriving does not make the path it names writable. A sandboxed `just
release` gets through the bump, commit, tag, `git push` and `gh release create`,
then dies on the marketplace step: `mv` of the `mktemp` file onto
`$MARKETPLACE_DIR/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` reports `inter-device move
failed … unable to remove target: Read-only file system`. Every step before it
is irreversible, so the plugin is left tagged and published against a stale
marketplace entry (confirmed 2026-07-30, gitlore 0.4.4). Run the whole recipe
unsandboxed. `just resume-release` (plugin-dev >= 0.5.0) recovers a half-landed
one, but only unsandboxed: its `bump_marketplace` runs that `mv`
unconditionally, before it compares local and remote heads, so inside the
sandbox it cannot even reach the point of reporting the marketplace already
correct.

**`git status` is auto-handled.** The `unsandbox-git-status` plugin (a PreToolUse
Bash hook) detects a `git status` command and flips `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`
in place, so it runs unsandboxed transparently. Caveats: detection is
best-effort (an unrecognised `git status` stays sandboxed), and it deliberately
does NOT cover `git add -A` (also fails sandboxed, but too dangerous to
auto-unsandbox). Its notice goes to `systemMessage` (user channel, not model
context), so the agent may never learn a command was auto-unsandboxed — do NOT
read a clean sandboxed `git status` as evidence the sandbox itself is clean.

**Slash-command context is sandboxed too.** Commands like
`/commit-commands:commit` auto-inject a `git status` into their `## Context`
block — that injection runs sandboxed (the auto-unsandbox plugin doesn't reach
it), so it lists the home dotfiles as untracked and can read as "nothing staged,
untracked files present" when the tree is actually clean. Never act on that
injected listing directly: re-run `git status` unsandboxed first. Never
stage/commit the materialized dotfiles (`.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.zshrc`, …) —
committing them pollutes the repo with personal config. Confirmed 2026-05-24: a
`/commit` context showed ~14 untracked dotfiles + `scripts/__pycache__/`; the
unsandboxed tree had only the build artifact, nothing to commit.

**How to apply:** run any *other* sandboxed command that reads the working tree,
or that writes to a sibling worktree, with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`.
Cues: phantom `.bashrc`/`.zshrc` in a listing; `Read-only file system` from a
`git -C <other-worktree>` op; the same error from a plain `cp`/`mv` into another
repo — the write allowlist covers the session's working directories and nothing
else. **Retry unsandboxed rather than reaching for a tool that is not under the
command sandbox.** Where the user's own prompt asked for the write, the auto
classifier lets the retry through, so routing around the denial buys nothing and
loses the shell. Relevant to finishing a development branch when merging a
worktree branch into main.

For *read-only* inspection of local git state and adjacent filesystem probes —
`git status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `branch`, `rev-parse`, `ls-files`,
`blame`, `cat .gitconfig`, `ls .claude/`, reading dotfiles — reaching for
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` is a standing default my human partner set
explicitly, not a per-case approval to seek: call it directly, without
pre-announcing or asking. Mutating operations (`git commit`, `push`, `reset`,
`checkout -- …`, anything that writes) are NOT covered and still follow normal
confirmation rules.

## Harness-mounted config paths are busy/read-only (sandbox breaks it)

The harness mounts certain paths as busy/read-only/char-devices:
`.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.git/config`,
`.mcp.json`, `.gitconfig`, `.gitmodules` and similar. The sandbox additionally
denies writes to `.claude/settings.json` outright. Any operation that unlinks or
rewrites one of them *in place* fails under the sandbox with **"Device or
resource busy"** or **"Read-only file system"**:

- `git checkout <branch>` and `git reset --hard` — they cannot unlink or
  overwrite the protected files.
- `git branch -d` — warns "could not write `.git/config`"; the branch is deleted
  anyway.
- Tools doing an atomic `mktemp` + `mv` into these paths (e.g.
  `claude-plugin-dev`'s `install.sh` settings-merge), because the `mktemp`
  lands on a different device.
- **A plugin's own `hooks/hooks.json`, when it is the active hooks config for
  the current session.** In gitlore's own repo, a sandboxed `git checkout`/`git
  merge --ff-only` that needs to change `hooks/hooks.json`'s content dies with
  `unable to unlink old 'hooks/hooks.json': Read-only file system` — the
  sandbox (or a harness-level mount under it) holds the file read-only
  regardless of the write-allowlist, because it's this session's own live
  hooks config. Every other file in the same checkout/merge updates normally;
  only the active `hooks.json` is special. Confirmed 2026-07-24 merging a
  branch into `main`: identical command succeeded once retried unsandboxed.

**How to apply:** run those operations with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`.
When `checkout` + `merge` choke on the protected files, a plain `git reset --hard
<branchtip>` unsandboxed completes the fast-forward cleanly. Note that the
harness `Edit` tool *can* write `.claude/settings.json` even though a raw git
unlink cannot — but the classifier still refuses `enabledPlugins`
([[classifier-denied-self-config]]).

**Recovering a merge interrupted mid-way by this failure:** a `git merge
--ff-only` that dies on `hooks/hooks.json` can leave the working tree
PARTIALLY updated to the target branch's content for files processed before
the failure, while HEAD stays at the pre-merge commit (git does not roll back
files it already wrote). Before retrying, `git status` and diff any "modified"
files against the merge target — if they already match the target exactly,
`git checkout HEAD -- <files>` to reset to the pre-merge commit and remove any
untracked new files the target added, THEN retry the merge unsandboxed in one
shot, rather than resuming piecemeal.

## `$TMPDIR` is unset when unsandboxed (cost of taking the escape)

When a Bash tool call runs with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox=true`, `$TMPDIR` is
**unset** (the sandbox is what exports it). A redirect like `cmd >
"$TMPDIR/foo.log"` then expands to `/foo.log` and dies with `Permission denied`.
Use the absolute scratchpad directory path in unsandboxed commands instead of
`$TMPDIR`.

Hit while running `just release minor` (needs network for `git push`/`gh`, so
the whole recipe ran unsandboxed). The release succeeded once the log redirect
used the absolute scratchpad path — including the cross-repo marketplace push to
`../claude-plugins`, which went through because the classifier evaluates the
top-level `just release minor`, not the inner `git -C "$MARKETPLACE_DIR" push`.

## `ps` cannot see harness background tasks (sandbox hides them)

The agent's Bash runs in its own PID namespace, so `ps` lists only that shell.
A Bash call made with `run_in_background` — and everything it spawns — is
absent from any process listing the agent can take: `ps -eo pid,comm` showed
two `bash` entries while a background `bats` suite was mid-run and went on to
complete normally.

**An empty `ps` is therefore not evidence that a background job died.** The
move it invites is starting the same work in the foreground to check, which
puts two heavy runs on a box that will not take parallel work; the second
times out, and both then look like the first one failing.

**How to apply:** treat the task-completion notification and the task's output
file as the only signals about a background job, and a process listing as no
signal at all. When waiting on one, key the wait on the command's exit rather
than on a line of its output that reads as terminal — a bats summary line
prints before the recipe has run its remaining steps.

## `--resume` dies because the transcript never persisted (second-order)

Inside the sandbox the API is reachable, but `~/.claude/projects/` (where session
transcripts are written) is read-only. So a `claude --print` turn completes and
returns a `session_id`, yet its transcript is never persisted — and a following
`claude --print --resume <id>` fails with "No conversation found with session
ID". The Agent SDK's `query()` has the same failure (it also spawns a subprocess
and resumes by id). Verified 2026-07-17: `touch ~/.claude/projects/.probe`
returns "Read-only file system"; the identical two-turn resume that failed
sandboxed returned `subtype: success` unsandboxed.

**Consequence for eval/harness design:** any two-turn (or N-turn) flow relying on
`--resume` must run **unsandboxed** (`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, or my human
partner's own shell). A single-turn connectivity **probe cannot detect this** —
it never resumes, so it passes sandboxed while the real flow cannot. gitlore's
`tests/evals/run-evals.sh` documents this in its header and its probe comment.
Related: [[classifier-denied-self-config]] (the gitdir is likewise
write-blocked, which is why the memory-message IPC file lives in the parent
worktree).

**So `just prerelease` and `just release` must run unsandboxed** — `release`
depends on `prerelease`, which runs `just evals`, which is exactly such a flow.
Sandboxed it fails at `pass^5` in a way that looks like it indicts the scenarios
or the code, and does not: every run of an affected scenario fails identically,
0/5 rather than flaky. Two signatures name the cause. Every two-turn scenario
reports `No conversation found with session ID: … turn 2 yielded no result`, and
`05-recall` reports `no session transcript captured` from its assertion, which
reads the transcript to tell an injected body from a self-issued Read. A third
tell is upstream of the evals and visible on every trial: `direnv: error open …
read-only file system` from the install step. Diagnose from these before
suspecting a scenario — and note that piping the gate into `tail` reports the
pipeline's exit status, so a failing run looks like exit 0.

## Cross-repo push needs `/add-dir` (classifier, not sandbox — the authorization escape)

When working in gitlore, pushing to the sibling `~/code/claude-plugins`
marketplace repo (needed whenever a plugin entry or version changes) is **denied
by the auto-mode classifier** — reason "external repo outside the trusted source
control org" — even though pushes to gitlore itself (the session cwd) go through.

What does *not* fix it: removing the `Bash(git push:*)` **ask** directives from
user config. Ask rules only control prompting; their absence is not
authorization, so the classifier still denies.

What fixes it: either an explicit **allow** rule
(`"permissions":{"allow":["Bash(git push:*)"]}`), or — cleanest — `/add-dir
~/code/claude-plugins`, which makes the repo a session working directory and the
classifier then trusts pushes to it. Confirmed 2026-05-23: after `/add-dir`, the
identical `git -C ~/code/claude-plugins push origin main` succeeded.

## zellij IPC socket is outside the sandbox (sandbox breaks it)

In a zellij session (`ZELLIJ_SESSION_NAME=...`), calling `zellij run --floating`,
`zellij action new-pane`, etc. from the Bash tool returns "There is no active
session!" under the default sandbox, even with explicit `--session <name>`. The
session exists (`zellij list-sessions` shows "current") but zellij's IPC unix
socket (typically under `/tmp/zellij-<uid>/zellij-<session>/`) is not reachable
from the sandbox.

**Fix:** call Bash with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`. The first symptom is
"no active session" from any zellij subcommand that needs to talk to the running
daemon (verified with `zellij --version` 0.44.3).

**Affects:** the `/revdiff:revdiff` skill launcher (`launch-revdiff.sh`) — it
picks the zellij branch when `ZELLIJ` is set and falls silently because the
launcher pipes `zellij run` stderr to `/dev/null`, so sandbox failure looks like
"exit 1 with no output"; and any future skill/script driving zellij from inside
CC. Once sandbox-disabled, the floating pane appears immediately.

## Sandboxed `claude -p` silently drops every `SessionStart` hook

A `claude -p <prompt>` spawned from inside the command sandbox needs to
`mkdir` a per-hook scratch dir under `~/.claude/session-env/<session-id>/`
before running each `SessionStart` hook, and that path sits outside the
sandbox's write allowlist. Every registered `SessionStart` hook across every
plugin — not just the one you're chasing — then fails with `EROFS:
read-only file system, mkdir '.../session-env/<id>'`. This surfaces only in
`[ERROR]`/`[DEBUG]` log lines (`-d hooks --debug-file <path>`); the turn
itself completes and returns its normal reply, so nothing in the visible
output signals that every `SessionStart` side effect was skipped.

Symptom: a fix that depends on a `SessionStart` hook's side effect appears
to do nothing even after the documented remedy. Confirmed 2026-08-11:
gitlore's `git config gitlore.hooksDir` (repointed to the current plugin
version every `SessionStart`, [[stale-plugin-code]]) stayed pinned at the
old version through two sandboxed `claude -p ping` calls in the target
repo — the standard "start a session there" remedy — and only updated once
retried with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`.

**How to apply:** run any `claude -p`/`--print` invocation whose *point* is
a `SessionStart` (or other) hook's side effect with
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`. A sandboxed one is fine only when you
need just the model's textual reply and no hook needs to fire around it.
[[posttooluse-print-mode]] establishes that `SessionStart` fires under
`--print` at all — that finding was made unsandboxed; this note is the
sandbox-specific caveat on top of it.

## Sandbox setup itself fails: `apply-seccomp: unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER): Invalid argument`

Distinct from every symptom above (a specific path/socket denied): the
sandboxing mechanism can fail to initialize at all, so an arbitrary
command — including a trivial read-only one like `grep` on a local file —
errors immediately with `apply-seccomp: unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER): Invalid
argument` and no other output, before the command itself runs. None of the
file/lock/socket diagnostics above apply, since the error names no path or
operation.

**How to apply:** this error string alone — no path named, no other
output — is sufficient evidence to retry with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox:
true` rather than spending a call diagnosing further.
