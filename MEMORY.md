# ddaanet tier index

Portable facts that hold across every ddaanet project — tooling behaviour,
Claude Code mechanics, shell and git gotchas. Project-specific facts stay in
the project's own memory store.

- [sandboxed git leaves index.lock](reference_sandbox_git_lockfile.md) — a sandboxed `git add` can strand `.git/index.lock` → the NEXT commit's pre-commit hook dies on "File exists"/"Another git process"; retry unsandboxed before suspecting the hook
- [bats bare `!` never fails](reference_bats_bang_no_fail.md) — a top-level `! cmd` in a @test asserts nothing (shellcheck SC2314); use `run ! cmd`
- [git refuses ext:: by default](reference_git_ext_transport.md) — `protocol.ext.allow=never` is the default, so a submodule clone of `ext::sh -c …` dies with "transport 'ext' not allowed"; an ext:: injection finding needs a loosened config — probe the policy, and separate shell injection from transport selection
- [protocol.file.allow blocks submodule clones](reference_git_protocol_file_allow.md) — a local-path `submodule add` dies with "transport 'file' not allowed"; repo config can't fix it because the CLONE reads the policy — use `-c`, or `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/KEY_0/VALUE_0` when you don't own the command line (survives a hook's local-env-vars unset)
- [mutation-check negative assertions](feedback_mutation_check_negatives.md) — an exemption/"stays silent" test passes vacuously against code that doesn't exist; break the guard it protects and watch that test go red before counting it
- [shell-gotchas before reviewing shell](feedback_shell_gotchas_on_review.md) — load `/shell-scripting:shell-gotchas` before reviewing `.sh`/`.bats`/hook diffs, not only before writing them; shellcheck cannot see the BSD/`set -e`/hook-env class, and the skill's "audit the whole touched script" changes the unit of review
- [living design doc structure](feedback_design_doc_structure.md) — six-section pattern for docs/design.md
- [agent executes, scripts decide](feedback_agent_executes.md) — detection logic in shell scripts, not agent reasoning
- [skill vs command](feedback_skill_vs_command.md) — self-triggering skill when condition is mechanical/detectable; command only for explicit user-initiated actions
- [fact-check before incorporating](feedback_fact_check.md) — verify user corrections against training knowledge, don't just defer
- [examine evidence for drift direction](feedback_examine_evidence_drift.md) — when two co-maintained artifacts diverge, get the drift direction from git history, don't assume a source of truth
- [loose generation + post-hoc fix](feedback_loose_generation.md) — let generator scaffold freely, constrain at artifact boundary
- [user: technical depth on LLM mechanism](user_technical_depth.md) — expects rigorous attention/cost/training claims, not hand-waving
- [CC interleaved thinking](reference_cc_interleaved_thinking.md) — thinking blocks are the hidden scaffolding channel (TUI renders text/tool_use only); older models need `alwaysThinkingEnabled: true` in settings.json
- [git status sandbox artifacts](feedback_git_status_sandbox.md) — sandbox surfaces phantom home dotfiles → sandboxed working-tree reads misreport; git status auto-unsandboxed by the unsandbox-git-status plugin (best-effort); sibling-worktree writes still blocked
- [decide/plan as late as possible, but not later](feedback_plan_late.md) — defer until evidence arrives, act before inaction decides by default
- [CC project-dir encoding](reference_cc_project_dir_encoding.md) — `~/.claude/projects/<name>/` mangling rule; reverse-engineered, edify's impl is incomplete
- [outside-in TDD when architecture is fixed](feedback_outside_in_tdd.md) — red e2e first, drive units by failure; black-box tests survive refactors
- [dogfood early](feedback_dogfood_early.md) — run new code on the actual production target the day it ships; fixtures miss real-world bugs
- [default to automation](feedback_automate_default.md) — automated tests by default; when a manual check is justified
- [verify handoff "pending" claims](feedback_verify_handoff_pending.md) — check commits + current code before treating handoff-noted feedback as outstanding
- [self-contained directives](feedback_self_contained_directives.md) — emit absolute paths + explicit cd; never rely on sub-agent's env or CWD
- [CC agent discovery](reference_cc_agent_discovery.md) — cwd `agents/` not auto-loaded; plugin must be marketplace-installed OR `--plugin-dir`-loaded for sub-agent dispatch; address as `<plugin>:<agent>`; defs cached per-session
- [large docs review](feedback_large_docs_review.md) — for big plan/spec docs, flag high-risk sections explicitly rather than asking for full eyeball pass
- [plan length matches work](feedback_plan_length_matches_work.md) — plan doc length tracks the executable work, not the topic
- [git hook env leak](reference_git_hook_env_leak.md) — hooks inherit repo-local `GIT_*`; clear the full set via `unset $(git rev-parse --local-env-vars)`, except `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, which a staging hook must restore for its `git add`
- [submodule escape to parent](reference_submodule_escape_to_parent.md) — git -C/cd into an unchecked-out submodule operates on the parent; guard with `[ -e path/.git ]`; linked-worktree = git-dir≠common-dir
- [CC sub-agent approval](reference_cc_subagent_approval.md) — two-turn return → SendMessage(approval) pattern; sub-agents have no addressable parent in one-shot dispatch
- [no hand-run tests](feedback_no_handrun_tests.md) — encode behavior in the bats suite; manual runs are for dogfooding the real product
- [verify delegated citations](feedback_verify_delegated_citations.md) — check author/title/venue specifics of agent-returned sources, not just URL existence; re-run code an agent claims it verified
- [spec vs code fact-check at writing-plans](feedback_spec_vs_code.md) — grep spec symbols against the codebase before writing test fixtures; spec concepts can drift from production semantics
- [harden human gates, not controlled channels](feedback_harden_human_gates.md) — apply word-boundary/escape recognition where a human types free-text, not on channels whose producer you control
- [CC command namespacing](reference_cc_command_namespacing.md) — `/<plugin>:<path-under-commands>`; keep commands flat or you get a double prefix
- [don't edit another repo in place](feedback_no_in_place_other_repos.md) — other repos stay read-only: investigate and propose a patch; the consent boundary is the working tree
- [cross-repo push auth](reference_cross_repo_push_auth.md) — pushing outside session cwd is classifier-denied; `/add-dir` authorizes it, removing ask rules doesn't
- [plugin cache staleness](reference_plugin_cache_staleness.md) — `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<owner>/<plugin>/<version>/` is a flat extraction keyed by version, so `/plugin update` no-ops when the version string is unchanged; verify loaded source before trusting any plugin-code verification
- [plugin recurse-clone submodule](reference_plugin_recurse_clone.md) — `/plugin install` recurse-clones; a committed submodule needs an absolute, public url or install aborts
- [hourglass display + stopped-state caching](reference_hourglass_display_caching.md) — displayed time = last API call + 1h; stopped states cached ~60 min
- [`!` shell shares agent cwd](reference_bang_shell_shared_cwd.md) — user's `!` command runs where the agent's last `cd` left the shell; make `!` commands cwd-independent
- [session title via custom-title transcript entry](reference_session_title_customtitle.md) — no hook-output field; `/rename` writes a `custom-title` jsonl line; a hook can append one to `transcript_path`
- [PostToolUse additionalContext in --print mode](feedback_posttooluse_print_mode.md) — under --print, PostToolUse hooks fire and wrapped hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext injects (tested 2.1.212); SessionStart/PreToolUse/PostToolBatch fire under --print too (2026-07-22), so a --print harness can drive the whole hook set; --print --resume does scripted multi-turn; SDK `query()` is stateless (spawns per call, `resume` replays) so BOTH harnesses re-prime every turn — measured 2026-07-17, SDK $0.379/14.4s vs --print --resume $0.425/24.3s per two-turn trial; pick on dependency footprint, not context reuse
- [strict sandbox blocks git writes](feedback_strict_sandbox_git.md) — dangerouslyDisableSandbox disabled in strict mode; git add/commit need user `!` or sandbox toggle
- [probing CC behavior via tmux PTY](reference_cc_behavior_probing_tmux_pty.md) — drive interactive claude in a bash tmux pane + inspect transcript JSONL; --disallowedTools tool-gating; --settings overrides gitlore hook
- [verify the session root](feedback_verify_session_root.md) — after a compaction, check PWD / CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR / gitStatus before acting; the 2026-07-20 wrong-root incident
- [hooks cannot inject tool calls](reference_hook_cannot_inject_tool_calls.md) — no `injectToolCall`/`forceRead` field exists (grepped 2.1.217); have the hook read the files and emit the bytes as `additionalContext` instead
- [CC hook output channels](reference_plugin_hook_user_channel.md) — systemMessage is the user-visible channel (works for SessionStart/PostToolUse); additionalContext is model-only and is honoured at PreToolUse as well as PostToolUse (verified 2026-07-17; arrives even when the tool call fails); stderr only on non-zero exit (code 2 or --verbose); basis for D14. To report a hook ERROR use systemMessage + **exit 0** — stdout JSON parses only on exit 0, so non-zero DISCARDS the message; only exit 2 blocks, and only at PreToolUse (PostToolUse can never block/undo)
- [CC worktree memory freeze](reference_cc_worktree_memory_freeze.md) — in-process EnterWorktree moves cwd but freezes launch env (PATH/autoMemoryDirectory/CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR); auto-memory strands on launch repo; cwd≠CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is the D15 drift signal; Enter/Exit confirmed to fire PostToolUse (targeted matcher)
- [CC hook reload mid-session](reference_cc_hook_reload.md) — CC re-reads hook config from settings.local.json mid-session, but NOT a plugin's hooks.json (even under `--plugin-dir .`): script bodies are live per invocation, event registration is frozen at session start — so a just-moved hook gets the OLD event's payload and silently no-ops; don't debug it, restart
- [shellcheck comment directive trap](reference_shellcheck_comment_directive.md) — a comment starting `# shellcheck` parses as a malformed directive and fails lint; .bats is linted too
- [prohibition vs procedure in always-on context](feedback_prohibition_vs_procedure.md) — front-load prohibitions, defer procedures to their trigger; a resident recipe turns into ceremony
- [test the invocation path, not just the code](feedback_test_the_invocation_path.md) — assert discovery, `[ -x ]`, and that the suite is listed in `make test`; the 100644 hook and 5 unlisted suites
- [git replay hooks](reference_git_replay_hooks.md) — `rebase --continue` does NOT fire pre-commit (2.47.3) but a hand commit/`--amend` at the stop and cherry-pick/revert `--continue` DO; a non-zero hook exit during a replay aborts the REBASE not the commit; detect via `--git-path rebase-merge|rebase-apply|CHERRY_PICK_HEAD|REVERT_HEAD`, MERGE_HEAD is not a replay; a submodule worktree doesn't move with the superproject's HEAD, so staging a gitlink mid-replay rewrites what the replayed commit recorded
- [no AskUserQuestion](feedback_no_askuserquestion.md) — David opted out of the tool; ask in numbered plain prose with a stated default
- [state current truth, no museum framing](feedback_state_current_truth.md) — present-tense standing truth in memory/docs/comments, no "used to be" framing; commit messages exempt
- [CC sandbox breaks --resume transcripts](reference_cc_sandbox_resume_transcript.md) — sandboxed `~/.claude/projects/` is read-only → a `--print` turn's transcript never persists → `--resume` dies `No conversation found with session ID`; two-turn flows (`just prerelease`/`release`, evals) must run unsandboxed — a single-turn probe passes and misses it
- [$TMPDIR unset when unsandboxed](reference_tmpdir_unset_unsandboxed.md) — use the absolute scratchpad path; `just release` runs unsandboxed and its cross-repo marketplace push passes the classifier as part of the top-level command
- [no stderr suppression](feedback_no_stderr_suppression.md) — drop `2>/dev/null`; prefer a guard, then capture-and-match, then a redirect justified inline; never guess in place of git's message
- [whitespace safety is essential](feedback_whitespace_safety.md) — a whitespace-unsafe parse is never a nit; test against a spaced input before ranking severity; default to NUL-delimited forms
- [git stderr + parsing mechanics](reference_git_stderr_and_parsing.md) — which git queries are silent on normal-absence (delete the redirect) vs noisy; `(fetch first)`/`(non-fast-forward)` = divergence vs `(pre-receive hook declined)` = policy; `-z --get-regexp` for whitespace-safe enumeration; `--git-common-dir` is relative in a main worktree → CDPATH trap; `-q` is ASYMMETRIC — `push -q` still names its rejection reason but `fetch -q` prints NOTHING on a non-fast-forward, so never classify a fetch rejection under `-q`; discriminator pinned by tests/push_rejection_discriminator.bats
- [zellij IPC sandbox](reference_zellij_ipc_sandbox.md) — `zellij run`/`action` need dangerouslyDisableSandbox=true; relevant for /revdiff:revdiff launcher
- [Sandbox-protected paths](reference_sandbox_protected_paths.md) — git checkout/reset/branch-d and atomic mv on .claude/settings.json & .git/config fail under sandbox; disable it for those ops
- [settings.json enabledPlugins edit blocked](feedback_settings_enabledplugins_blocked.md) — classifier blocks Claude editing enabledPlugins even after approval; give user a !-command instead
- [Validate non-TDD tests by mutation](feedback_test_validation_by_mutation.md) — tests written after the code must each be turned red by a deliberate fault to prove they bite
